Subject: FNT Motor Group - AutoTrader Integration Ready for Production

---

Hi Paul,

Apologies for the delayed response – we've been thoroughly testing the AutoTrader integration to ensure everything works perfectly before going live.

I'm pleased to confirm that FNT Motor Group is now ready for production with the AutoTrader API integration.

**What We've Successfully Tested:**

✅ Stock synchronization via API (scheduled every 30 minutes)
✅ Real-time webhooks for instant updates
✅ Price and inventory updates working correctly
✅ Vehicle availability automatically syncing (advertised/unadvertised)
✅ All vehicle data mapping correctly to our website
✅ Images and descriptions displaying properly

**Current Setup:**

• Environment: Sandbox (ready to switch to Production)
• Advertiser ID: 10042804
• Webhook URL: https://fntmotorgroup.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/autotrader-webhook
• Webhook signature verification: Ready (awaiting secret key)

**To Complete Go-Live, We Need:**

1. Production API credentials (or confirmation sandbox credentials work in production)
2. Webhook secret key for signature verification
3. Any specific go-live requirements from AutoTrader

Please let us know the next steps to move forward with the production launch.

Thank you for your support throughout the integration process!

Best regards,
FNT Motor Group
Development Team
